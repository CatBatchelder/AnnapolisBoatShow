                Set in the seaport of Annapolis, we displays catamarans, mono hulls, racing boats, and inflatables - a
                total of over 100 new and brokerage boats. Check out the vessels and spend some time shopping for the
                latest equipment, including electronics, clothing, and other accessories. Attend Seminars, small
                concerts, venders, and jump on to hundred of boats for a weekend only Annapolis can provide.
